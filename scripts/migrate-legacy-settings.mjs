/**
 * Carry a 1.7.x settings section into the loader row 2.0 reads.
 *
 * DSH 0.1 kept each plugin's settings in `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml`, keyed by the
 * plugin's section id. 0.2 imports that file into each loader entry's `config` —
 * but only for entries whose plugin registered a `Config`, and this plugin's Host
 * half never did (it called `settings.installSection`, which 0.2 removed, and
 * nothing threw). So on an upgrade the plugin's whole section was left behind: it
 * is left out of the import, the plugin boots with every default,
 * and the settings page has no row to write to — dsh's config editor refuses the
 * write with "overridden by a home patch or command-line overlay".
 *
 * This reads that stranded section and writes it into the plugin's own row in the
 * profile patch, which is where 2.0 reads configuration from. Every field name and
 * value shape is identical between the two versions — the only change is *where*
 * the object lives — so the migration is a move, not a translation. Fields the
 * current `Config` does not declare are dropped rather than guessed at, and a row
 * that already carries settings is never touched, because the settings page writes
 * into that same block and a stale legacy file must not overwrite a live edit.
 *
 * Exit codes, so the installer can tell the cases apart without parsing output:
 *   0  migrated
 *   3  nothing to migrate (no plugin row, no usable legacy section, or the row
 *      already carries settings) — attempt measured, nothing left to do
 *   1  a real failure: unreadable or malformed YAML, or the patch could not be written
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/migrate-legacy-settings.mjs --profile web [--dry-run]
 *
 * Options:
 *   --dsh-home <dir>   DSH home                     (default: $DSH_HOME or ~/.dsh)
 *   --profile <name>   profile to migrate           (default: $DSH_PROFILE or web)
 *   --plugin-id <id>   plugin id and legacy section key (default: model-request-accelerator)
 *   --dry-run          print the patch instead of writing it
